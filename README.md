## Description
I built the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
Youâ€™ll need to use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

## Usage

GIVEN a functional Express.js API<br/>
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file<br/>
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize<br/>
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands<br/>
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data<br/>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br/>
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database<br/>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags<br/>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br/>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core<br/>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database<br/>
